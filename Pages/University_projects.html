			<p> - Applied machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to analyze a dataset of 40,000 rows of marketing campaign data from a Portuguese bank.

			    - Developed a highly accurate predictive model for subscription outcome, correctly identifying "no" responses as a true “no” 93% of the time.
			    - Potential for substantial time and resource savings for the company through targeted call strategies.
